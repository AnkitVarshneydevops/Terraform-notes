A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. 
It means if you are provisioning any resources on any cloud infrastructure or physical hosts, 
terraform need to be provision the resources on behalf of you to interact with the service provider like aws, azure etc. 
To access those resources on behalf of you it require name of provider, 
it's like why we need to provision the infrastructure on GCP or aws etc. 
That is need to provider aws.
