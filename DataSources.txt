DataSources
==============
=> For certain providers (like AWS), terraform provides datasources
=> Datasources provide you with dynamic information
=> A lot of data is available by AWS in a structured format using their API.
=> Terraform also exposes this information using data sources.
Examples: List of AMIs,availabilty zones.
Another great example is the datasource that gives you all IP addresses in use by AWS.
This is great if you want to filter traffic based on an AWS region.
e.g. allow all traffic from amazon instances in Europe
Filtering traffic in AWS can be done using security groups
Incoming and outgoing traffic can be filtered by protocol, IP range, and port.
Similar to iptables (linux) or a firewall appliance.
