if you are creating any infrastructure into cloud platform using terraform, 
whatever infrastructure you are creating, all the resources are recorded by 
the terraform on your local laptop, that's why it is called local states, 
since you can run a terraform from your local laptop to make the changes 
into your cloud, if I want to provision s3 bucket, vpc or any of the 
resources of our aws cloud, I can run the terraform code from our local laptop, 
whenever we are going to run the terraform code and when we are running 
command that terraform plan or apply, it's created state file for us on 
same directory when you are running terraform code and whatever the 
resources you have created, all the resources recorded inside the particular terraform state file.
== terraform state is used to do the modification, 
or any kind of updation or deletion, if you want to do in your running infrastructure which is created by terraform scripts.
